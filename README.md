# nanonis_file_analysis
Python functions to analyze nanonis files - .sxm and .3ds.

This uses the stmpy module which needs to be downloaded: 

    pip install hoffmanstmpy
    
source: https://github.com/hoffmanlabcoding/stmpy/tree/main

"Image_analysis" contains the class for analysis of the nanonis image data - .sxm
The notebook "sxm_image.ipynb" shows sample code for working with the .sxm file.

"cits_analysis" contains the class for analysis of the CITS data - .3ds
The notebook "CITS_data_analysis.ipynb" shows sample code for working with the .3ds files

Sample data are also attached
